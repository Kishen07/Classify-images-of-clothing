This project involves building and training a neural network to classify images of clothing items using the Fashion MNIST dataset, which includes 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, each representing one of ten clothing categories such as T-shirts, trousers, and dresses. The model is constructed using TensorFlow and Keras, with a simple architecture comprising a flattening layer, a dense hidden layer with ReLU activation, and a softmax output layer for classification. The dataset is preprocessed by normalizing the pixel values, and the model is trained over several epochs to optimize its performance. The trained model is then evaluated on the test set, and its accuracy is assessed. This project provides a thorough pipeline for image classification, from data loading and preprocessing to model training and evaluation, demonstrating a practical application of machine learning in fashion image recognition.
